0 Transactions are possible but are zero for a given period.
"(*) Transactions between zero and +/- $500,000."
(D) Suppressed to avoid the disclosure of data of individual companies.
"n.a. Transactions are possible, but data are not available."
"..... Not applicable, or for data periods 1960-1997, transactions that are 0, not available, or not applicable."
Quarterly estimates are not annualized and are expressed at quarterly rates.
"1. Secondary income (current transfer) receipts and payments include U.S. government and private transfers, such as U.S. government grants and pensions, fines and penalties, withholding taxes, personal transfers (remittances), insurance-related transfers, and other current transfers."
"2. Transactions for financial derivatives are only available as a net value equal to transactions for assets less transactions for liabilities.  A positive value represents net U.S. cash payments arising from derivatives contracts, and a negative value represents net U.S. cash receipts."
"3. The statistical discrepancy, which can be calculated as line 38 less line 37, is the difference between total debits and total credits recorded in the current, capital, and financial accounts.  In the current and capital accounts, credits and debits are labeled in the table.  In the financial account, an acquisition of an asset or a repayment of a liability is a debit, and an incurrence of a liability or a disposal of an asset is a credit."
"4. Current- and capital-account statistics in the International Transactions Accounts differ slightly from statistics in the National Income and Product Accounts (NIPAs) because of adjustments made to convert the international transactions statistics to national economic accounting concepts.  A reconciliation between annual statistics in the two sets of accounts appears in table 4.3C of the <a href=""https://apps.bea.gov/iTable/?reqid=19&amp;step=3&amp;isuri=1&amp;nipa_table_list=415&amp;categories=survey"">NIPA Interactive Data Application</a>."
"5. Net lending means that U.S. residents are net suppliers of funds to foreign residents, and net borrowing means the opposite.  Net lending or net borrowing can be computed from current- and capital-account transactions or from financial-account transactions.  The two amounts differ by the statistical discrepancy."
