    "text": "The Big Picture\n\n\n\nThe U.S. Dollar Index (DXY) has a wide-reaching impact on many areas of the global economy, making it a critical subject of study. This analysis will consider the following five main areas:\n\nU.S. International Trade: The value of the dollar directly affects the volume and value of U.S. imports and exports. Understanding this relationship is key to analyzing how global trade dynamics shift in response to currency fluctuations.\nDomestic Economic Indicators: The strength or weakness of the dollar has implications for domestic economic growth, employment rates, and inflation. These indicators are essential for assessing the broader economic health of the United States.\nThe Gold Market: The price of gold is often inversely related to the U.S. dollar. Examining how the dollar’s fluctuations affect gold prices can shed light on global investor behavior and market sentiment.\nGlobal Capital Markets: Changes in the value of the dollar can influence capital flows, global investment decisions, and asset allocations. This section will explore the dollar’s role in shaping global financial markets.\nGlobal Commodity Prices: As many commodities are priced in U.S. dollars, shifts in the dollar’s value can have significant effects on the pricing and demand for key resources like oil and metals.\nCOVID-19 Impact: The COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound effect on global economies, including currency markets. This section will examine how the pandemic influenced the U.S. Dollar Index and its effects on various economic sectors before and after the crisis.",

    "section": "Literature Review",
    "text": "Literature Review\n\nU.S. International Trade\nBruno and Shin (2020)1 investigate the impact of U.S. dollar appreciation on international trade, focusing on the financial channel through which exchange rates influence export performance. They highlight that while a stronger dollar typically improves trade competitiveness for exporters, it also tightens credit conditions, particularly for firms reliant on dollar-funded bank credit. Their study shows that exporters with greater exposure to dollar-based financing experience a significant slowdown in exports due to reduced credit availability, even when controlling for other factors. The authors argue that this financial channel, which operates counter to the competitiveness channel, has a substantial effect on global trade, especially for credit-intensive sectors. Their findings emphasize the importance of the U.S. dollar not only as a trade currency but also as a key factor in shaping global trade finance, with dollar fluctuations having a notable impact on export growth.\n\n\nDomestic Macroeconomic Factors\nManning and Andrianacos (2020)2 explore the relationship between U.S. dollar movements and domestic inflation, using cointegration analysis to assess both short-term and long-term effects. Their study finds that, in the long run, there is no significant relationship between the yen/dollar exchange rate and U.S. price levels. However, in the short term, the authors observe that U.S. monetary authorities adjust policies in response to changes in consumer prices and exchange rates, although the price level itself does not directly respond to fluctuations in the exchange rate. This suggests that while the U.S. dollar may influence inflationary pressures in the short term, it does not have a lasting impact on the domestic price level when controlling for other macroeconomic factors, such as income and interest rates. Their findings contribute to the understanding of how domestic economic conditions, alongside currency movements, shape inflation dynamics in the U.S. economy.\n\n\nThe Gold Market\nMo, Nie, and Jiang (2020)3 explore the dynamic relationships between the gold market, the U.S. dollar, and the crude oil market, with a particular focus on the impact of the global financial crisis. Their analysis reveals that there is a long-term dependence among these markets, with a positive dynamic relationship between gold and oil, and a negative relationship between oil and the U.S. dollar. Using fractional cointegration and DCC-MGARCH models, they find that fluctuations in the U.S. dollar have a notable effect on the gold market, particularly after the 2007-2009 financial crisis. The study also highlights a non-linear causal relationship, where gold influences the U.S. dollar and the U.S. dollar in turn affects crude oil prices. These findings emphasize the interconnectedness of the gold market with both the dollar and the oil market, offering valuable insights for investors and policymakers in managing portfolios and crafting macroeconomic strategies.\n\n\nGlobal Capital Markets\nSiddiqui (2020)4 critically reviews the role of the U.S. dollar in the global economy, particularly in light of the U.S.’s relative decline as a global economic power. Despite this decline, the U.S. continues to dominate global financial systems through the operations of multinational corporations and its control over international financial architecture. The study emphasizes the central role of the U.S. dollar as the world’s primary reserve currency, while also acknowledging the rising challenge from the Chinese renminbi. Siddiqui argues that while the renminbi poses a potential threat to the U.S. dollar’s supremacy, it is unlikely to replace the dollar as the global currency in the near future. The paper highlights the ongoing importance of the U.S. dollar in global capital markets, as well as the growing pressures on the U.S. economy due to persistent trade deficits. This underscores the complex dynamics of currency dominance and its implications for global economic stability.\n\n\nGlobal Commodity Prices\nBoz, Gopinath, and Plagborg-Møller (2020)5 examine the influence of the U.S. dollar on global trade and commodity prices. They find that fluctuations in the U.S. dollar exchange rate significantly affect trade prices and volumes. A stronger U.S. dollar tends to decrease global trade volumes, including commodities, with a 1% appreciation in the dollar leading to a 0.6-0.8% decline in trade volumes. Their study highlights the U.S. dollar’s dominant role in global trade, suggesting that its fluctuations are a key predictor of commodity prices and global inflation, particularly in markets for oil and metals. This reinforces the notion that the U.S. dollar is a central factor in shaping commodity price movements worldwide.\n\n\nCOVID-19 Impact\nAccording to Bertaut et al. (2023)6, despite the increased geopolitical risks and the rise of alternative currencies, the U.S. dollar’s position as the world’s primary reserve currency remained largely stable post-COVID. The U.S. Dollar Index (DXY), which measures the dollar’s strength against a basket of currencies, reflected heightened volatility during the pandemic as global markets reacted to economic uncertainties. However, the dollar’s central role in global finance was reinforced, with countries continuing to anchor their currencies to the dollar. The author suggest that while challenges to dollar dominance, such as the rise of the Chinese renminbi and digital currencies, are emerging, the U.S. dollar’s status remains secure, particularly due to its liquidity, stability, and the extensive use of dollar-denominated assets in international markets.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n1.

From 2009 to 2020, the trade balance remained relatively stable, with a slight decline, possibly reflecting steady economic conditions and moderate shifts in trade patterns.

    "text": "3. Macroeconomic Factors\n\nGDPUnemploymentCPI\n\n\nGross Domestic Product (GDP) is the total value of all goods and services produced within a country, and it consists of four main components: consumption, investment, government spending, and net exports. Consumption refers to household spending on goods and services, while investment includes business capital spending, residential construction, and changes in inventories. Government spending covers expenditures on goods and services, excluding transfer payments, and net exports are the difference between a country’s exports and imports. Together, these components provide a comprehensive measure of a country’s economic activity.\n\n\nCode\ngdp &lt;- read.csv(\"./data/gdp.csv\")\ngdp$time &lt;- as.Date(seq(from = as.Date(\"2005-01-01\"), to = as.Date(\"2024-09-01\"), by = \"quarter\"))\ngdp_long &lt;- pivot_longer(gdp, \n                         cols = c(consumption, investment, net_export, government), \n                         names_to = \"Category\", \n                         values_to = \"Value\")\n\ngg &lt;- ggplot(gdp_long, aes(x = time, y = Value, fill = Category)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\") +\n  labs(x = \"Year\", y = \"Billions of Dollars\", \n       title = \"Total Contribution to GDP by Time and Category\", \n       fill = \"Category\") +\n  scale_fill_brewer(palette = \"Set3\") +\n  theme(\n    axis.text = element_text(size = 11),  \n    axis.title = element_text(size = 11, face = 'bold'), \n    title = element_text(size = 12, hjust = 0.5, face = 'bold'),\n    panel.background = element_rect(fill = \"white\"), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_line(color = \"gray\", linetype = \"dotted\"),\n    panel.grid.major = element_line(color = \"gray\", linetype = \"dotted\")\n  ) +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::comma_format())\n\nplotly_gg &lt;- ggplotly(gg)\nplotly_gg \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe plot shows the four components of U.S. GDP over time. From earlier analysis, we know that the U.S. consistently runs a $200 billion trade deficit, which aligns with the negative $200 billion net exports in this plot. Government spending has remained relatively stable, while investment has grown slightly. Consumption, however, has increased significantly, rising from $8,551 billion in 2005 to $19,938 billion in 2025. This highlights that consumption is the dominant part of U.S. GDP and suggests that investment may be insufficient, which could hinder technological progress.\nGDP experienced two major declines, one in 2008 due to the financial crisis and another in 2020 caused by COVID-19. The 2008 decline had a lasting impact on GDP, leading to a slower recovery with steady growth afterward. In contrast, the 2020 drop was followed by a rapid rebound, with GDP growth accelerating even beyond its previous trend.\n\n\nThe unemployment rate is the percentage of the labor force that is unemployed but actively seeking work. It is a key indicator of economic health, as a high unemployment rate suggests that an economy may be underperforming, with insufficient job opportunities. Conversely, a low unemployment rate indicates a more thriving job market and better economic conditions.\n\n\nCode\ndata_unem &lt;- read.csv(\"./data/unem.csv\", header=TRUE)\ndata_unem$time &lt;- as.Date(data_unem$time)\ngg &lt;- ggplot(data = data_unem, aes(x = time, y = unem)) +   \n  geom_line(color='purple') +  \n  labs(x = \"Year\", y = \"Rate\", title = \"U.S. Unemployment Rate Over Time\")\n\nplotly_gg &lt;- ggplotly(gg)\nplotly_gg\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom 2008 to 2009, the unemployment rate increased significantly, primarily due to the global financial crisis. The economic recession led to business closures, layoffs, and a reduction in investments, causing a massive loss of jobs. This spike in unemployment reflects the severe impact the economic downturn had on the labor market.\nFrom 2009 to 2020, the unemployment rate consistently decreased as the economy recovered. This was due to a steady economic growth, increased job creation, and recovery in industries that had been hit hard during the recession. With the rise in consumer demand and business expansions, more job opportunities became available, helping bring the unemployment rate down.\nIn 2020, the unemployment rate spiked dramatically due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which led to widespread lockdowns, business closures, and disruptions in many industries. However, the recovery was quick. By 2022, the unemployment rate returned to pre-pandemic levels. This rapid recovery can be attributed to government stimulus measures, the adaptation of businesses to new operating models (such as remote work), and the strong rebound in sectors like technology and e-commerce.\n\n\nThe Consumer Price Index (CPI) measures the average change in prices paid by consumers for goods and services over time. It is used to track inflation, reflecting the cost of living in a particular country.\n\n\nCode\ndata_cpi &lt;- read.csv(\"./data/cpi.csv\", header=TRUE)\ndata_cpi$time &lt;- as.Date(data_cpi$time)\ngg &lt;- ggplot(data = data_cpi, aes(x = time, y = cpi)) +   \n  geom_line(color='purple') +  \n  labs(x = \"Year\", y = \"Index\", title = \"U.S. CPI Over Time\")\n\nplotly_gg &lt;- ggplotly(gg)\nplotly_gg\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom 2005 to 2024, the overall trend in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) shows a gradual increase, indicating rising inflation over the period. In 2008, there was a brief spike in CPI, likely due to the global financial crisis, but it quickly returned to normal levels as the economy stabilized. However, after 2021, the rate of increase in CPI accelerated, largely due to the economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, supply chain disruptions, and rising demand as economies reopened. This surge in inflation reflects higher costs in goods and services, influenced by both global and domestic economic factors.",

The S&P GSCI serves as a key indicator for investors looking to gain exposure to commodity markets and is often used as a reference for commodity-focused investment products like ETFs and futures contracts.\n\n\nCode\ngsci &lt;- read.csv(\"./data/gsci.csv\", header=TRUE)\ngsci$Date &lt;- as.Date(gsci$Date)\n\ngg &lt;- ggplot(data = gsci, aes(x = Date, y = Price)) +   \n  geom_line(color='purple') +  \n  labs(x = \"Year\", y = \"Dollar ($)\", title = \"S&P GSCI Index (USD) Over Time\")\n\nplotly_gg &lt;- ggplotly(gg)\nplotly_gg\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe plot shows a significant increase in the S&P GSCI Index from 2020 to 2022, likely due to supply chain disruptions and rising energy prices.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 led to severe supply chain challenges, causing volatility in commodity markets. While some commodities, especially energy, saw price drops early in the pandemic, recovery efforts later fueled surging demand and price increases, particularly in energy and metals. As economies reopened, supply chains struggled to keep up, leading to shortages in key commodities such as oil, natural gas, and metals, which drove up prices.\nAnother major factor was the energy crisis in 2021-2022. As global energy demand rebounded, supply remained constrained, especially in oil and natural gas. Geopolitical tensions, including Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in early 2022, further worsened energy shortages, causing oil and gas prices to soar. Since energy commodities make up a large portion of the S&P GSCI Index, these price spikes significantly impacted its overall trend.",

However, between 2007 and 2011, there was a decline in the index, likely due to the global financial crisis, which caused a sharp contraction in the housing market. This period saw widespread defaults, a credit crunch, and a drop in demand for housing. After 2011, the index steadily increased, reflecting the recovery of the housing market, supported by factors such as low interest rates, improved economic conditions, and a resurgence in demand for real estate.\n\n\nWe use the Non-U.S. Resident Visitor Arrivals to the United States as the indicator that measures the tourism market.

This pattern was driven by consistent global tourism growth and improved travel accessibility. However, in 2020, there was a sharp decline in arrivals due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which caused travel restrictions, lockdowns, and a significant reduction in international mobility. Since then, there has been a slow recovery in visitor numbers, although they have not yet reached pre-pandemic levels. The gradual recovery reflects the ongoing adjustments in the global travel industry and the challenges posed by the lingering effects of the pandemic.",

It is a key indicator of economic health, as a high unemployment rate suggests that an economy may be underperforming, with insufficient job opportunities. Conversely, a low unemployment rate indicates a more thriving job market and better economic conditions. It helps policymakers assess the effectiveness of economic policies and determine whether interventions are needed to promote job growth.\n\n\n\n\nCPI\n\nData Source: U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.5: U.S. CPI Over Time.

It is used to track inflation, reflecting the cost of living in a particular country. The CPI is a critical indicator for policymakers, as it helps in adjusting wages, pensions, and social security benefits to keep up with inflation. A rising CPI indicates inflationary pressures, while a falling CPI may signal deflation, both of which have significant implications for the economy.",

However, it does not exhibit clearly periodic fluctuations across years. I preliminarily consider it to follow an multiplicative model.\n\n\n\n\nCode\nbea &lt;- read.csv(\"./data/bea.csv\")\nbea$time &lt;- as.Date(bea$time)\n\ngg &lt;- ggplot(bea) + \n  geom_line(aes(x = time, y = balance/1000), color = \"purple\") +\n  labs(x = \"Year\", y = \"Billions of Dollars\", \n  title = \"Trends of Trade Balance\")\n\nplotly_gg &lt;- ggplotly(gg)\nplotly_gg\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe time series plot of the trade balance shows a strong seasonality, with July being the lowest month each year and January being the highest. This pattern may be due to factors such as seasonal fluctuations in demand and supply, where imports tend to increase during the holiday season in December, leading to a higher trade deficit in January. On the other hand, July may see a dip in trade activity due to summer holidays, reduced production, and lower consumer demand.\n\n\n\n\nCode\ngdp &lt;- read.csv(\"./data/gdp.csv\")\ngdp$time &lt;- as.Date(gdp$time)\ngdp$total &lt;- gdp$consumption + gdp$investment + gdp$net_export + gdp$government\ngg &lt;- ggplot(data = gdp, aes(x = time, y = total)) +   \n  geom_line(color='purple') +  \n  labs(x = \"Year\", y = \"Billions of Dollars\", title = \"GDP Over Time\")\n\nplotly_gg &lt;- ggplotly(gg)\nplotly_gg\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe time series plot of GDP shows a steady increasing trend. Since the raw data we extracted from the BEA is seasonally adjusted at annual rates, there is no noticeable seasonality in the data. Given this, I preliminarily consider the time series to follow an additive model, where the trend is consistent over time and the variations are not influenced by seasonal patterns. This additive model helps capture the general growth trajectory without the need for seasonal adjustments.\n\n\n\n\nCode\ndata_unem &lt;- read.csv(\"./data/unem.csv\", header=TRUE)\ndata_unem$time &lt;- as.Date(data_unem$time)\ngg &lt;- ggplot(data = data_unem, aes(x = time, y = unem)) +   \n  geom_line(color='purple') +  \n  labs(x = \"Year\", y = \"Rate\", title = \"U.S. Unemployment Rate Over Time\")\n\nplotly_gg &lt;- ggplotly(gg)\nplotly_gg\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe unemployment rate increased significantly, showing both the upwarding trend and seasonality.

Lag plot\nBased on the time series plots above, we apply log transformation to the following variables: USD Index, Unemployment Rate, Gold Price, Global Commodity Price, and Number of International Visitors. This transformation is used to stabilize variance, reduce skewness, and better model the growth patterns in these variables.

It indicates that we fail to reject the null hypothesis at the 10% significance level. This means there is insufficient evidence to conclude that the U.S. Dollar Index is stationary. Therefore, it is likely that the U.S. Dollar Index contains a unit root and is non-stationary.\n\n\n\n\nCode\nadf.test(balance_ts)\n\n\n\n    Augmented Dickey-Fuller Test\n\ndata:  balance_ts\nDickey-Fuller = -2.1425, Lag order = 4, p-value = 0.5174\nalternative hypothesis: stationary\n\n\nThe p-value in the ADF test for the exports data is 0.12. This indicates that we fail to reject the null hypothesis at the 10% significance level, but there is still some degree of significance. Considering the conclusions from Part 4 with the ACF and PACF plots, it is possible that the ADF test is detecting non-stationarity due to a unit root. However, the exports time series may actually be trend stationary, meaning it has a trend rather than a unit root, which the ADF test cannot detect. As a result, the test fails to reject the null hypothesis, but the marginal significance suggests that the series might still exhibit some form of non-stationarity that is related to a trend rather than a unit root.\n\n\n\n\nCode\nadf.test(gdp_ts)\n\n\n\n    Augmented Dickey-Fuller Test\n\ndata:  gdp_ts\nDickey-Fuller = -0.0084786, Lag order = 4, p-value = 0.99\nalternative hypothesis: stationary\n\n\nThe p-value in the ADF test for the GDP is 0.99.

This suggests that the time series for all variables are non-stationary, as their statistical properties, such as mean and variance, change over time. To make the time series stationary, we need to apply differencing, which helps to remove trends and make the data more stable over time, ensuring that the statistical properties are constant. Therefore, differencing is required to achieve stationarity for further time series analysis.",

    "text": "What is a Time Series ?\n\nAny metric that is measured over regular time intervals makes a Time Series. A time series is a sequence of data points or observations collected or recorded over a period of time at specific, equally spaced intervals. Each data point in a time series is associated with a particular timestamp or time period, making it possible to analyze and study how a particular variable or phenomenon changes over time. Time series data can be found in various domains and can represent a wide range of phenomena, including financial data, economic indicators, weather measurements, stock prices, sales figures, and more.\n\nExample: Weather data, Stock prices, Industry forecasts, etc are some of the common ones.\n\nThe analysis of experimental data that have been observed at different points in time leads to new and unique problems in statistical modeling and inference.\nThe obvious correlation introduced by the sampling of adjacent points in time can severely restrict the applicability of the many conventional statistical methods traditionally dependent on the assumption that these adjacent observations are independent and identically distributed.\n\nKey characteristics of time series data include:\nTemporal Order: Time series data is ordered chronologically, with each data point representing an observation at a specific point in time. The order of data points is critical for understanding trends and patterns over time.\nEqually Spaced Intervals: In most cases, time series data is collected at regular intervals, such as hourly, daily, weekly, monthly, or yearly. However, irregularly spaced time series data can also exist.\nDependency: Time series data often exhibits temporal dependency, meaning that the value at a given time is influenced by or related to the values at previous times. This dependency can take various forms, including trends, seasonality. This serial correlation is called as autocorrelation.\nComponents: Time series data can typically be decomposed into various components, including:\nTrend: The long-term movement or direction in the data. Seasonality: Repeating patterns or cycles that occur at fixed intervals. Noise/Irregularity: Random fluctuations or variability in the data that cannot be attributed to the trend or seasonality.\nApplications: Time series data is widely used for various applications, including forecasting future values, identifying patterns and anomalies, understanding underlying trends, and making informed decisions based on historical data.\nAnalyzing time series data involves techniques like time series decomposition, smoothing, statistical modeling, and forecasting. This class will cover but not be limited to traditional time series modeling including ARIMA, SARIMA, the multivariate Time Series modeling including; ARIMAX, SARIMAX, and VAR models, Financial Time Series modeling including; ARCH, GARCH models, and E-GARCH, M-GARCH..ect, Bayesian structural time series (BSTS) models, Spectral Analysis and Deep Learning Techniques for Time Series. Researchers and analysts use software tools like Python, R, and specialized time series libraries to work with and analyze time series data effectively.\nTime series analysis is essential in fields such as finance, economics, epidemiology, environmental science, engineering, and many others, as it provides insights into how variables change over time and allows for the development of predictive models to forecast future trends and outcomes.",

Overall, these stock prices exhibit an upward trend. In particular, Netflix saw a rapid rise in stock price from 2016 to 2020, with its price reaching twice that of Microsoft in 2021. However, in 2022, the stock prices of all three companies declined, especially Netflix, which saw a sharp drop followed by a slight recovery. This could be related to the post-pandemic decrease in consumer demand, particularly for Netflix’s video content. Compared to Netflix and Microsoft, Disney’s stock price remained relatively lower and more stable.\n\n\n\n\nCode\n#plotly\n# candlestick plot\n\ngetSymbols(\"ETH-USD\", from = \"2024-04-01\", to = \"2024-05-01\")\n\n\n[1] \"ETH-USD\"\n\n\nCode\ndf &lt;- data.frame(Date = index(`ETH-USD`), coredata(`ETH-USD`))\ndf &lt;- tail(df, 30)\ncolnames(df) &lt;- c(\"Date\", \"Open\", \"High\", \"Low\", \"Close\", \"Volume\")\n\nfigc &lt;- df %&gt;% plot_ly(x = ~Date, type = \"candlestick\",\n                       open = ~Open, close = ~Close,\n                       high = ~High, low = ~Low)\nfigc &lt;- figc %&gt;% layout(title = \"Ethereum (ETH) Candlestick Plot\")\n\nfigc\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEthereum (ETH) is a decentralized cryptocurrency widely used in blockchain technology.

In April, ETH’s price fluctuated significantly, reaching a high of $3727 and a low of $2815 on May 1. Although the price experienced fluctuations, the overall trend showed a decline.\n\n\nHover over the interactive plot to see the difference.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(dotenv)\nlibrary(fredr)\n\nfredr_set_key(trimws(Sys.getenv(\"FRED_API_KEY\")))\n\ngdp_data &lt;- fredr(series_id = \"GDP\", \n                  observation_start = as.Date(\"2013-01-01\"), \n                  observation_end = as.Date(\"2024-12-31\"))\n\nfig &lt;- gdp_data %&gt;%\n  plot_ly(x = ~date, y = ~value, type = 'scatter', mode = 'lines', \n          line = list(color = 'blue')) %&gt;%\n  layout(title = 'US GDP',\n         subtitle = 'From 2013-2024',\n         xaxis = list(title = 'Date'),\n         yaxis = list(title = 'GDP in Billions of USD'))\n\nfig\n\n\n\n\n\n\nU.S. GDP (Gross Domestic Product) reflects the overall size and growth of the U.S. economy.
