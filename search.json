    "text": "The Big Picture\n\n\n\nThe U.S. Dollar Index (DXY) has a wide-reaching impact on many areas of the global economy, making it a critical subject of study. This analysis will consider the following five main areas:\n\nU.S. International Trade: The value of the dollar directly affects the volume and value of U.S. imports and exports. Understanding this relationship is key to analyzing how global trade dynamics shift in response to currency fluctuations.\nDomestic Economic Indicators: The strength or weakness of the dollar has implications for domestic economic growth, employment rates, and inflation. These indicators are essential for assessing the broader economic health of the United States.\nThe Gold Market: The price of gold is often inversely related to the U.S. dollar. Examining how the dollar’s fluctuations affect gold prices can shed light on global investor behavior and market sentiment.\nGlobal Capital Markets: Changes in the value of the dollar can influence capital flows, global investment decisions, and asset allocations. This section will explore the dollar’s role in shaping global financial markets.\nGlobal Commodity Prices: As many commodities are priced in U.S. dollars, shifts in the dollar’s value can have significant effects on the pricing and demand for key resources like oil and metals.\nCOVID-19 Impact: The COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound effect on global economies, including currency markets. This section will examine how the pandemic influenced the U.S. Dollar Index and its effects on various economic sectors before and after the crisis.",

    "section": "Literature Review",
    "text": "Literature Review\n\nU.S. International Trade\nBruno and Shin (2020)1 investigate the impact of U.S. dollar appreciation on international trade, focusing on the financial channel through which exchange rates influence export performance. They highlight that while a stronger dollar typically improves trade competitiveness for exporters, it also tightens credit conditions, particularly for firms reliant on dollar-funded bank credit. Their study shows that exporters with greater exposure to dollar-based financing experience a significant slowdown in exports due to reduced credit availability, even when controlling for other factors. The authors argue that this financial channel, which operates counter to the competitiveness channel, has a substantial effect on global trade, especially for credit-intensive sectors. Their findings emphasize the importance of the U.S. dollar not only as a trade currency but also as a key factor in shaping global trade finance, with dollar fluctuations having a notable impact on export growth.\n\n\nDomestic Macroeconomic Factors\nManning and Andrianacos (2020)2 explore the relationship between U.S. dollar movements and domestic inflation, using cointegration analysis to assess both short-term and long-term effects. Their study finds that, in the long run, there is no significant relationship between the yen/dollar exchange rate and U.S. price levels. However, in the short term, the authors observe that U.S. monetary authorities adjust policies in response to changes in consumer prices and exchange rates, although the price level itself does not directly respond to fluctuations in the exchange rate. This suggests that while the U.S. dollar may influence inflationary pressures in the short term, it does not have a lasting impact on the domestic price level when controlling for other macroeconomic factors, such as income and interest rates. Their findings contribute to the understanding of how domestic economic conditions, alongside currency movements, shape inflation dynamics in the U.S. economy.\n\n\nThe Gold Market\nMo, Nie, and Jiang (2020)3 explore the dynamic relationships between the gold market, the U.S. dollar, and the crude oil market, with a particular focus on the impact of the global financial crisis. Their analysis reveals that there is a long-term dependence among these markets, with a positive dynamic relationship between gold and oil, and a negative relationship between oil and the U.S. dollar. Using fractional cointegration and DCC-MGARCH models, they find that fluctuations in the U.S. dollar have a notable effect on the gold market, particularly after the 2007-2009 financial crisis. The study also highlights a non-linear causal relationship, where gold influences the U.S. dollar and the U.S. dollar in turn affects crude oil prices. These findings emphasize the interconnectedness of the gold market with both the dollar and the oil market, offering valuable insights for investors and policymakers in managing portfolios and crafting macroeconomic strategies.\n\n\nGlobal Capital Markets\nSiddiqui (2020)4 critically reviews the role of the U.S. dollar in the global economy, particularly in light of the U.S.’s relative decline as a global economic power. Despite this decline, the U.S. continues to dominate global financial systems through the operations of multinational corporations and its control over international financial architecture. The study emphasizes the central role of the U.S. dollar as the world’s primary reserve currency, while also acknowledging the rising challenge from the Chinese renminbi. Siddiqui argues that while the renminbi poses a potential threat to the U.S. dollar’s supremacy, it is unlikely to replace the dollar as the global currency in the near future. The paper highlights the ongoing importance of the U.S. dollar in global capital markets, as well as the growing pressures on the U.S. economy due to persistent trade deficits. This underscores the complex dynamics of currency dominance and its implications for global economic stability.\n\n\nGlobal Commodity Prices\nBoz, Gopinath, and Plagborg-Møller (2020)5 examine the influence of the U.S. dollar on global trade and commodity prices. They find that fluctuations in the U.S. dollar exchange rate significantly affect trade prices and volumes. A stronger U.S. dollar tends to decrease global trade volumes, including commodities, with a 1% appreciation in the dollar leading to a 0.6-0.8% decline in trade volumes. Their study highlights the U.S. dollar’s dominant role in global trade, suggesting that its fluctuations are a key predictor of commodity prices and global inflation, particularly in markets for oil and metals. This reinforces the notion that the U.S. dollar is a central factor in shaping commodity price movements worldwide.\n\n\nCOVID-19 Impact\nAccording to Bertaut et al. (2023)6, despite the increased geopolitical risks and the rise of alternative currencies, the U.S. dollar’s position as the world’s primary reserve currency remained largely stable post-COVID. The U.S. Dollar Index (DXY), which measures the dollar’s strength against a basket of currencies, reflected heightened volatility during the pandemic as global markets reacted to economic uncertainties. However, the dollar’s central role in global finance was reinforced, with countries continuing to anchor their currencies to the dollar. The author suggest that while challenges to dollar dominance, such as the rise of the Chinese renminbi and digital currencies, are emerging, the U.S. dollar’s status remains secure, particularly due to its liquidity, stability, and the extensive use of dollar-denominated assets in international markets.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n1.

Total Contribution to GDP by Time and Category\nGross Domestic Product (GDP) is the total value of all goods and services produced within a country, and it consists of four main components: consumption, investment, government spending, and net exports. Consumption refers to household spending on goods and services, while investment includes business capital spending, residential construction, and changes in inventories. Government spending covers expenditures on goods and services, excluding transfer payments, and net exports are the difference between a country’s exports and imports.

From earlier analysis, we know that the U.S. consistently runs a $200 billion trade deficit, which aligns with the negative $200 billion net exports in this plot. Government spending has remained relatively stable, while investment has grown slightly. Consumption, however, has increased significantly, rising from $8,551 billion in 2005 to $19,938 billion in 2025. This highlights that consumption is the dominant part of U.S. GDP and suggests that investment may be insufficient, which could hinder technological progress.\nGDP experienced two major declines, one in 2008 due to the financial crisis and another in 2020 caused by COVID-19. The 2008 decline had a lasting impact on GDP, leading to a slower recovery with steady growth afterward. In contrast, the 2020 drop was followed by a rapid rebound, with GDP growth accelerating even beyond its previous trend.",

While some commodities, especially energy, saw price drops early in the pandemic, recovery efforts later fueled surging demand and price increases, particularly in energy and metals. As economies reopened, supply chains struggled to keep up, leading to shortages in key commodities such as oil, natural gas, and metals, which drove up prices.\nAnother major factor was the energy crisis in 2021-2022. As global energy demand rebounded, supply remained constrained, especially in oil and natural gas. Geopolitical tensions, including Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in early 2022, further worsened energy shortages, causing oil and gas prices to soar. Since energy commodities make up a large portion of the S&P GSCI Index, these price spikes significantly impacted its overall trend.",

Exports include both tangible products (goods) and intangible products (services) such as financial services, tourism, and intellectual property.\nImports of Goods and Services: This refers to the value of all goods and services that the U.S. purchases from foreign countries. It encompasses both physical goods (such as electronics, machinery, etc.) and services (such as insurance, transportation, and consulting).\nFinancial Account: The financial account records transactions that involve financial assets and liabilities. It reflects the net change in ownership of U.S. financial assets and liabilities, including direct investments, portfolio investments, and other financial instruments.\nFinancial Outflow: The net U.S. Acquisition of Financial Assets Excluding Financial Derivatives (Net Increase in Assets) measures the U.S.’s net purchases of foreign financial assets, such as stocks, bonds, and real estate. A net increase in assets indicates a financial outflow from the U.S. to other countries.\nFinancial Inflow: The net U.S. Incurrence of Liabilities Excluding Financial Derivatives (Net Increase in Liabilities) refers to the net increase in foreign investments or loans in the U.S., including foreign direct investment, portfolio investment, and other types of financial liabilities. A net increase in liabilities indicates a financial inflow into the U.S. from foreign entities.\nQuarterly, Not Seasonally Adjusted: The data is provided on a quarterly basis, which allows for a better understanding of short-term fluctuations and trends compared to annual data. The data is not seasonally adjusted because seasonal variations (such as those due to holidays or weather) will be analyzed and removed in later analysis.",

It serves as a comprehensive indicator of a nation’s economic performance. GDP includes the value of consumption, investment, government spending, and net exports (exports minus imports). It is often used to compare the economic health of different countries or to track the economic performance of a single country over time.",

It is the most widely used measure of gold’s market value and is influenced by factors like global demand for gold, inflation expectations, and economic stability. This price fluctuates throughout the trading day based on market dynamics and is a crucial benchmark in the gold market.",

    "text": "What is a Time Series ?\n\nAny metric that is measured over regular time intervals makes a Time Series. A time series is a sequence of data points or observations collected or recorded over a period of time at specific, equally spaced intervals. Each data point in a time series is associated with a particular timestamp or time period, making it possible to analyze and study how a particular variable or phenomenon changes over time. Time series data can be found in various domains and can represent a wide range of phenomena, including financial data, economic indicators, weather measurements, stock prices, sales figures, and more.\n\nExample: Weather data, Stock prices, Industry forecasts, etc are some of the common ones.\n\nThe analysis of experimental data that have been observed at different points in time leads to new and unique problems in statistical modeling and inference.\nThe obvious correlation introduced by the sampling of adjacent points in time can severely restrict the applicability of the many conventional statistical methods traditionally dependent on the assumption that these adjacent observations are independent and identically distributed.\n\nKey characteristics of time series data include:\nTemporal Order: Time series data is ordered chronologically, with each data point representing an observation at a specific point in time. The order of data points is critical for understanding trends and patterns over time.\nEqually Spaced Intervals: In most cases, time series data is collected at regular intervals, such as hourly, daily, weekly, monthly, or yearly. However, irregularly spaced time series data can also exist.\nDependency: Time series data often exhibits temporal dependency, meaning that the value at a given time is influenced by or related to the values at previous times. This dependency can take various forms, including trends, seasonality. This serial correlation is called as autocorrelation.\nComponents: Time series data can typically be decomposed into various components, including:\nTrend: The long-term movement or direction in the data. Seasonality: Repeating patterns or cycles that occur at fixed intervals. Noise/Irregularity: Random fluctuations or variability in the data that cannot be attributed to the trend or seasonality.\nApplications: Time series data is widely used for various applications, including forecasting future values, identifying patterns and anomalies, understanding underlying trends, and making informed decisions based on historical data.\nAnalyzing time series data involves techniques like time series decomposition, smoothing, statistical modeling, and forecasting. This class will cover but not be limited to traditional time series modeling including ARIMA, SARIMA, the multivariate Time Series modeling including; ARIMAX, SARIMAX, and VAR models, Financial Time Series modeling including; ARCH, GARCH models, and E-GARCH, M-GARCH..ect, Bayesian structural time series (BSTS) models, Spectral Analysis and Deep Learning Techniques for Time Series. Researchers and analysts use software tools like Python, R, and specialized time series libraries to work with and analyze time series data effectively.\nTime series analysis is essential in fields such as finance, economics, epidemiology, environmental science, engineering, and many others, as it provides insights into how variables change over time and allows for the development of predictive models to forecast future trends and outcomes.",

Effective visualization allows analysts and decision-makers to extract meaningful insights from the data, aiding in better understanding the dynamics of a system over time. The choice of visualization techniques is crucial, as it directly influences the interpretation of patterns within the time series.\nThe ability to discern seasonality, identify anomalies, and recognize patterns is vital for making informed predictions and strategic decisions. Furthermore, interactive features in visualizations enable users to delve deeper into the data, offering a dynamic and exploratory experience.\nUltimately, the clarity and accuracy of time series data visualization contribute significantly to enhancing decision-making processes across various domains, such as finance, healthcare, environmental monitoring and many other areas.\n\nStock Price TrendsETH Candlestick PlotU.S. GDP Trend\n\n\nThe following graph shows overall trends in Disney, Microsoft, and Netflix.\n\n\nCode\noptions(\"getSymbols.warning4.0\"=FALSE)\noptions(\"getSymbols.yahoo.warning\"=FALSE)\n\ntickers = c(\"NFLX\",\"MSFT\",\"DIS\" )\nfor (i in tickers){\n  getSymbols(i,\n             from = \"2013-01-01\",\n             to = \"2024-12-31\")}\n\nx &lt;- list(\n  title = \"date\"\n)\ny &lt;- list(\n  title = \"value\"\n)\n\nstock &lt;- data.frame(NFLX$NFLX.Adjusted,\n                    MSFT$MSFT.Adjusted,\n                    DIS$DIS.Adjusted)\n\n\nstock &lt;- data.frame(stock,rownames(stock))\ncolnames(stock) &lt;- append(tickers,'Dates')\n\nstock$date&lt;-as.Date(stock$Dates,\"%Y-%m-%d\")\nhead(stock)\n\n\n               NFLX     MSFT      DIS      Dates       date\n2013-01-02 13.14429 22.40697 45.88776 2013-01-02 2013-01-02\n2013-01-03 13.79857 22.10680 45.98655 2013-01-03 2013-01-03\n2013-01-04 13.71143 21.69305 46.86658 2013-01-04 2013-01-04\n2013-01-07 14.17143 21.65249 45.77102 2013-01-07 2013-01-07\n2013-01-08 13.88000 21.53891 45.58244 2013-01-08 2013-01-08\n2013-01-09 13.70143 21.66060 45.60041 2013-01-09 2013-01-09\n\n\nCode\n################################################\n\nggplot(stock, aes(x=date)) +\n  geom_line(aes(y=NFLX, colour=\"NFLX\"))+\n  geom_line(aes(y=MSFT, colour=\"MSFT\"))+\n  geom_line(aes(y=DIS, colour=\"DIS\"))+\n   labs(\n    title = \"Stock Prices for the Tech Companies\",\n    subtitle = \"From 2013-2024\",\n    x = \"Date\",\n    y = \"Adjusted Closing Prices\")+\n    theme(panel.background = element_rect(fill = \"white\", colour = \"grey50\"))+\n    guides(colour=guide_legend(title=\"Tech Companies\")) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe plot above shows the stock price trends of Disney (DIS), Microsoft (MSFT), and Netflix (NFLX) from 2013 to 2024.
