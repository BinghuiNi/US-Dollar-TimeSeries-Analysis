- **Description:** This dataset contains **quarterly** U.S. **Gross Domestic Product (GDP)** in billions from **2005 Q1 to 2024 Q3**.  

  - **Gross Domestic Product (GDP):** GDP is the total monetary value of all goods and services produced within a countryâ€™s borders over a specific period, typically measured annually or quarterly. It serves as a comprehensive indicator of a nation's economic performance. GDP includes the value of consumption, investment, government spending, and net exports (exports minus imports).

- **Description:** This dataset contains **monthly** U.S. **unemployment rate** data from **2005-01 to 2024-12**.   

  - **Unemployment Rate:** The unemployment rate is the percentage of the labor force that is unemployed but actively seeking work. It is a key indicator of economic health, as a high unemployment rate suggests that an economy may be underperforming, with insufficient job opportunities. Conversely, a low unemployment rate indicates a more thriving job market and better economic conditions. It helps policymakers assess the effectiveness of economic policies and determine whether interventions are needed to promote job growth.

The CPI is a critical indicator for policymakers, as it helps in adjusting wages, pensions, and social security benefits to keep up with inflation. A rising CPI indicates inflationary pressures, while a falling CPI may signal deflation, both of which have significant implications for the economy.
